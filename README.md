Encryption Programming Assignment for CS370

Encryption:

In order to run the Encryption program, you simply need run the file from within a Python development environment. 
I used PyCharm for development and am able to run the program by selecting Run > Run > Encryption. The file will need to placed where ever you normally execute 
python programs from.

Strong Collision:

In order to run the Strong Collision program, you simply need run the file from within a Python development environment. 
I used PyCharm for development and am able to run the program by selecting Run > Run > Strong_Collision. The file will need to placed where ever you normally execute 
python programs from. You can change the number of test passes by changing the value that is in the strong_collision function call. Currently it
is set for 100 passes, which takes almost no time run.

Weak Collision:

In order to run the Weak Collision program, you simply need run the file from within a Python development environment. 
I used PyCharm for development and am able to run the program by selecting Run > Run > Weak_Collision. The file will need to placed where ever you normally execute 
python programs from. You can change the number of test passes by changing the value that is in the weak_collision function call. Currently it
is set for 5 passes, that is due to the time it takes the program to complete execution. I ran this roughly 10 times with 5 passes each time to get my average results. 
I would recommend running no more than 5 passes each time just due to the time it takes to complete.
